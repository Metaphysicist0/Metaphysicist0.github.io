Hi! I am Tianliang Yao, a year 1 Ph.D. student at the [AIM group](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~yxyuan/index.htm) at the [Department of Electronic Engineering](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html), supervised by Prof. [Yixuan Yuan](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~yxyuan/). I received my B.Eng degree from the [Department of Control Science and Engineering](https://cse.tongji.edu.cn/), [College of Electronics and Information Engineering](https://see.tongji.edu.cn/) at [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/), guided by Prof. [Peng Qi](https://cse.tongji.edu.cn/6b/68/c15581a158568/page.htm).
