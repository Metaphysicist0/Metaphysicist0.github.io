<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student at the [AIM group](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~yxyuan/index.htm) at the [Department of Electronic Engineering](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html), supervised by Prof. [Yixuan Yuan](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~yxyuan/). Previously, I received my B.Eng. degree from the [Department of Control Science and Engineering](https://cse.tongji.edu.cn/), [College of Electronics and Information Engineering](https://see.tongji.edu.cn/) at [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/) in 2025, guided by Prof. [Peng Qi](https://cse.tongji.edu.cn/6b/68/c15581a158568/page.htm) and collaborated with Prof. [Bo Lu](https://lu-bo.github.io/) from Soochow University.

**Recent focus:** AI-Driven Healthcare, Embodied Intelligence for Medical Robotics.
